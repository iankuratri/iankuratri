## Hello, I am Ankur Atri

I am a Frontend Developer and my role is to write and style frontend components that meet the requirements of our mocks and fulfil our user stories.

I have two years of industry experience in building websites and web applications. I specialize in Angular and have professional experience working with Typescript, JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap, CSS and HTML.

I love learning and experimenting new things. Recently, I have started learning and working on the basic concepts of React and Node.js.
